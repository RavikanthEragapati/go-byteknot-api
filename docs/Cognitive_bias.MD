As a software engineer it will be beneficial for me to keep my head down and only talk about technology, system design and architecture - but today I would like to switch gears and dive into kind of sensitive topic and my 2nd favourite subject Cognitive Bias.

Aside from being an engineer, I also am a mentor both at work and outside work and have personally had my own Bias and have seen people with Bias and not recognize them. If you are going to say I do not have any Bias then what you have is a "bias blind spot".

# Cognitive Biases

# How to Mitigate Cognitive Biases

While it is not impossible to eliminate all biases, awareness and specific strategies can help moderate their influence:
* Be Aware: The first step is recognizing that biases exist and can affect your judgment.
* Seek Diverse Perspectives: Consulting with objective people or considering different viewpoints can help identify blind spots and challenge your assumptions.
* Challenge Your Own Beliefs: Actively look for information that disconfirms your existing viewpoints, rather than just information that supports them.
* Avoid Decisions Under Pressure: Take time to ruminate, list pros and cons, and think critically before making significant decisions.
* Reflect on Past Decisions: Learn from previous outcomes to identify patterns in your own biased thinking.
